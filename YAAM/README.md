# YAAM
## Yet Another Autofishing Mod

## Features
- Autocast
- Autoreel
- Automash

All toggleable!

## Using
### This mod requires [Tacklebox](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/PuppyGirl/TackleBox/) to function!
Configure the mod config either directly in the `GDWeave/Configs/YAAM.json` or by using [Tacklebox](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/PuppyGirl/TackleBox/)

If autocasting is enabled equipping the fishing rod will always cast it as soon as possible. This will make equipping anything else or moving impossible. Turn off Autocasting in the Mods menu to stop this.

## Planned Features:
~~- Tacklebox support~~ (Added in 1.0.1)
- Toggle between short and long distance casts
