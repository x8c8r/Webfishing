# YAAM
## Yet Another Autofishing Mod

## Features
- Autocast
- Autoreel
- Automash

All toggleable!

## Using
Configure the mod config either directly in the `GDWeave/Configs/YAAM.json` or by using [Tacklebox](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/PuppyGirl/TackleBox/)

If autocasting is enabled equipping the fishing rod will always cast it as soon as possible. This will make doing anything else impossible. By opening the inventory the rod will be removed from your hands allowing you to do things again. This will be fixed with Tacklebox support.

Changing the config currently will only take place on restarts.

## Planned Features:
- Tacklebox support
- Toggle between short and long distance casts
