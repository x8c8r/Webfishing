## Yet Another Autofishing Mod

## Features
- Autocast
- Autoreel
- Automash
- Cast Distance Slider

All toggleable!

## Using
### This mod requires [Tacklebox](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/PuppyGirl/TackleBox/) to function!
The mod is best configued via a Quick Menu, added to the right side of the screen.

## PLEASE READ THIS
- If autocasting is enabled equipping the fishing rod will always cast it as soon as possible. This will make equipping anything else or moving impossible. Turn off Autocasting in the Quick Menu.
- If in-game "Autoclick" option is enabled - It will prevent automash from working properly, make sure to have it turned off if you plan on using automash.
