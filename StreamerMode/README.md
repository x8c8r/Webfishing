# StreamerMode

Mod that lets streamers disable certain things in order to safely stream the game.

## This mod makes these things disableable:
- Chatbox
- Speech Bubbles
- Chalk Canvases

## Using
You can edit the config either inside [HLS](hooklinesinker.lol) or by using [Tacklebox](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/PuppyGirl/TackleBox/)

### Disabled value means that that thing won't be visible!
